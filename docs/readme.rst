About osc-physrisk-financial
----------------------------

An `OS-Climate <https://os-climate.org>`_ project, osc-physrisk-financial is a library for valuating assets under different climate risk scenarios.

Using the library
-----------------

The library can be run locally and is installed via::

   pip install osc-physrisk-financial

The library uses the output generated by the `physrisk <https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk>`_ library.

Note
----

This is the first stage of development, where the models are intentionally simple, focusing on setting up the proper structure of the library.
